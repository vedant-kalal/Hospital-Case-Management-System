**Hospital Case Management System** 
> A comprehensive platform for managing patient cases, clinicians, health centers, and case notes.

📖 Description
-------------
The Hospital Case Management System is a Python-based application designed to streamline the management of patient cases, clinicians, health centers, and case notes. This system provides a robust and scalable solution for hospitals and healthcare organizations to efficiently manage their daily operations. With a user-friendly interface and a robust database, this system enables clinicians to create, update, and manage patient cases, as well as track case notes and health center information.

The system is built using a modular architecture, with separate modules for patient cases, clinicians, health centers, and case notes. Each module is designed to be independent and scalable, allowing for easy maintenance and updates. The system also includes a robust logging mechanism, which provides detailed logs of all system activities.

The Hospital Case Management System is designed to be highly customizable, with a flexible data model that can be easily extended to support additional features and requirements. With its robust security features and scalable architecture, this system is an ideal solution for hospitals and healthcare organizations of all sizes.

The system's key features include patient case management, clinician management, health center management, and case note management. These features enable clinicians to efficiently manage patient cases, track case notes, and access health center information. The system also includes a robust reporting mechanism, which provides detailed reports on system activities and patient case information.
